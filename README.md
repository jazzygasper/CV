## Jasmina Gasper

An enthusiastic software developer excited about technology and its potential to make positive change in the world. Having a background in Graphic Design, I value opportunities to think out of the box and express myself creatively, while my experience retraining at an intensive coding bootcamp made me an expert in picking up new software skills quickly. With a career spanning over 6 years, I've been instrumental in actively guiding and contributing to projects end-to-end in both global enterprises and emerging startups.
