## Jasmina Gasper

An enthusiastic software developer who is excited about the potential of technology. I love to be creative and inventive, and learn new software skills quickly. After graduating from Central Saint Martins and discovering my passion for coding, I completed an intensive coding bootcamp at Makers Academy, which enabled me to work as part of a high-performing squad at AND Digital. An ambitious coder, I am now looking for a new role that will help me grow as a software developer.

<!-- ## Skills

#### Design

At Central Saint Martins I majored in BA Graphic Design, specializing in Design and Interaction, with a focus on digital media and marketing. I am meticulous, with a keen visual sense and focus on getting the details correct. I believe my creativity and appreciation of visual aesthetics helps me to create beautiful and clean code. I'm not just a coder executing a brief, I am also full of ideas and motivated to create amazing experiences for different people.

<!-- #### Creativity

I am the type of person who thinks outside the box. As someone who is creative on my feet, it helps me be an efficient problem-solver. I love to wrangle code and furnish the front-end to bring that idea to life.

#### Drive
