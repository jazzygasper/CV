## Skills

#### Design

At Central Saint Martins I majored in BA Graphic Design, specializing in Design and Interaction, with a focus on digital media and marketing. I am meticulous, with a keen visual sense and focus on getting the details correct. I believe my creativity and appreciation of visual aesthetics helps me to create beautiful and clean code. I'm not just a builder working to order, I believe I am full of ideas and motivated to create amazing experiences for people.
